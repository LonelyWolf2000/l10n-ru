Also, you can choose to <em>lowercase</em> the file name or leave it with mixed case, and finally you can define a custom prefix to prepend, either a fixed one (like the name of your blog) or a date-based one. Feel free to play with the settings and save them, because you can check in this page what kind of transformation will be applied."
