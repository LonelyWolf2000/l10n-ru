== Description ==

An awesome plugin that allows users to login, register and retrieve passwords from any page on your blog. They will then be sent back to that page upon success or error, unless you specify otherwise in the settings, where users can be specifically redirected by their role. You can also choose whether or not to show gravatars when a user is logged in, and whether or not the dashboard and profile links are shown based upon user role.


== Installation ==

1. Upload the `simplelogin` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. You can then either use SimpleLogin as a widget or insert it directly into your template with a call to `<?php simplelogin(); ?>`
